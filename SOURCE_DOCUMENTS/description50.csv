Description
"GVX provides weight reduction, no-paint solution with advantage of corrosion resistance compared with Aluminum. Impact and UV, weathering resistance meet customer's requirements"
"Grilamid TR is a problem solver when other products like PC, PC/ABS, PSU, PES, PPSU fail due to stress cracking, discoloration or alternating bending requirements"
"Biobased polyamides are a new class of bioplastics that are derived from renewable resources such as natural fats and oils. The majority of these bioamides are based on sebacic acid with the exception of polyamide 11 (also called Nylon 11 or Polyundecanolactam) which is based on undecylenic acid. Bio Polyamides are not Biodegradable. The EMS products that are biopolymers are Grilamid 1S (PA1010), Grilamid 2S (PA610), Grilamid BTR (Transparent PA) and Grivory HT3 (PPA) "
"Unlike other aliphatic polyamides, Grivory GV grades exhibit  lower and slower humidity absorption making them particularly suitable for replacing metals. Smart design will reduce cost weight and provide more ecological solutions"

"Grilon TS is an alloy from PA66 and PA6, that combined the mechanical properties from PA66 and the processing advantages and surface finish of PA6. "
"Long Chain Polyamides aka LCPA are PA12, PA11, PA610, PA612, PA1010, PA1012. Lower water absorption compared to PA 6, PA 66, polyphthalamide (PPA) and PA 46 and, as a result, higher dimensional stability and a limited variation of properties in case of changes in ambient humidity. High chemical resistance in contact with calcium chloride and zinc chloride solutions. Excellent resistance to peroxides. Excellent resistance in contact with motor cooling fluids, largely exceeding the performance ensured by PA 66. These polyamides can replace the reinforced-rubber hoses used for the cars’ cooling and heating systems. In some cases, they represent a valid alternative to products like PPA. Lower permeability to fuels. High resistance to hydrolysis in contact with hot water; this property, together with good dimensional stability, makes these polyamides suitable for the manufacturing of components which can replace brass in plumbing and heating systems. High resistance to gear lubrication oil, for example, of clutch fluid ducts"
"any polymer (substance composed of long, multiple-unit molecules) in which the repeating units in the molecular chain are linked together by amide groups. Amide groups have the general chemical formula CO-NH. They may be produced by the interaction of an amine (NH2) group and a carboxyl (CO2H) group, or they may be formed by the polymerization of amino acids or amino-acid derivatives (whose molecules contain both amino and carboxyl groups). Broadly defined, the polyamides include proteins and peptides, which are naturally produced polymers consisting of amino-acid repeating units. (In molecular biology the amide linkage is usually referred to as the peptide bond.) More narrowly defined, the polyamides are an important group of industrially produced synthetic polymers. The most important is nylon, actually an extremely versatile class of polymers that are made into indispensable fibers and plastics. Another class of polyamides made into fibers is the so-called aramids, or aromatic polyamides—amide polymers that contain phenyl rings in their repeating units. Some nylons also contain phenyl rings, so the two classes are actually distinguished by the number and frequency of the rings. When 85 percent or more of the amide groups are linked directly to phenyl rings, the polyamide is classified as an aramid. When the rate is lower than 85 percent, the polymer is classified as a nylon"
"Comparison Zytel ST 811 with Grilon BZ 3/2 and Grilon BRZ 344 H. The mechanical properties of Zytel ST811 and Grilon BRZ-334H are comparable while Grilon BZ 3/2 is significantly stiffer. Grilon BRZ 334 H increase in weight (+10%) after storage in Shell Helix Plus at 150C for 200h while no weight change can be determined for Grilon BZ 3/2 and Zytel ST 811 is even lighter (-3.5%). Zytel ST 811 shows significant warpage and the larges change of hole diameter, Grilon BZ 3/2 is the best in this comparison "
"In order to pass the new EURO V7 (China V7) permeation tests new polymers are required. The permeation of the currently used Grilamid LV-3A HX is too high. EMS has developed Grilamid FE 12230 which has a different matrix concept for this. Although initial trials were very promising, reconfirmation trials showed a marginal improvement. EMS has discontinued this project. "
"A guide for injection molders on how to process engineering plastics. It covers topics such as selection of the machine and peripherals, screw geometry, determination of screw diameter, shot weight and metering stroke, nozzles, protection against wear, sealing faces, temperature control of the mold, processing reclaim, coloring with masterbatches and measures for the elimination of molding faults"
"How to design, calculate and optimize the load-bearing capacity and rigidity of Pressurised containers in plastics, using different shapes, flanges, seals and ribbing. Listing the factors that affect the strength and rigidity of thermoplastic materials, such as time, temperature, ambient media and processing, and how to estimate them. It shows the relative load-bearing and rigidity values of some elementary cross-sectional shapes (cylinder, rectangle, ellipse, etc.), some standard base shapes (hemisphere, dished, flat, etc.) and some flange types suited to plastics (lapped, screwed, etc.). General advice on gate position, connections, allowable stress values and validity: It gives some recommendations on how to achieve the highest moulded part quality, avoid stress concentrations and notch effects, make allowance for ambient media and safety margins, and transpose the results to other structures with similar geometric proportions"
"The end of life vehicle regulation 2000/53/ec is a European Union directive that aims to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles that are no longer in use. It has the following main objectives:

To prevent and limit waste from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) and their components by ensuring their reuse, recycling and recovery.
To improve the environmental performance of all economic operators involved in the life-cycle of vehicles, such as manufacturers, importers, distributors and waste treatment facilities.
To restrict the use of certain hazardous substances, such as lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium, in new vehicle manufacturing processes, except in defined exemptions when there are no adequate alternatives.
To set clear targets for the reuse, recycling and recovery of ELVs and their components, which have become increasingly more demanding over time.
To provide systems for the collection and treatment of ELVs, including the issuance of certificates of destruction and the deregistration of vehicles.
To make manufacturers responsible for meeting all or a significant part of the costs involved in the delivery and treatment of ELVs.
The directive applies to passenger vehicles and small trucks, but not to big trucks, vintage vehicles, special-use vehicles and motorcycles. It was amended several times to adapt to scientific and technical progress and to introduce new rules on delegated and implementing acts. In 2023, the Commission proposed a new regulation on end-of-life vehicles, following a review. The new regulation aims to make the automotive sector more circular, to maximize the efficient use of resources and to protect the environment."
"The transmission of light or laser through polymers is affected by various factors. The most significant ones are the thickness of the part, the temperature of the tool and the hold on pressure. The transmission increases as the crystallization decreases."
"﻿In this paper, the mechanical properties of polyphthalamides samples processed by injection molding have been investigated. The thermomechanical properties have been studied through DMTA experiments. All the studied PPA exhibit a characteristic dynamic mechanical response for a thermoplastic material. Three relaxations processes have been identified, denoted γ, β and α from the lower to the higher temperature. The impact properties were studied on a broad temperature range, using an instrumented Charpy impact test. The three PPA samples showed a brittle-ductile transition varying from a low energy dissipated during impact test to a high energy dissipated during impact of the order 130–160 kJ m!2. At room temperature, the three PPA studied are brittle. They should be used for a composite application and thus improve their Tbd. The tensile and the compression behavior of three PPA with different degree of crystallinity have been studied. In tensile test, the PPA with the largest crystallinity is brittle at room temperature (Polyamide C), while the polyamide A and polyamide B are ductile. In both tests, we observed a strain hardening behavior, which is more pronounced in compression. The strain hardening regime in tensile test is influenced by the temperature as well as the amorphous or semi-crystalline character of the studied PPA. The measured strain hardening moduli in compression are around 18 MPa for the three PPA at 23 ""C. The values of the ESH modulus are relatively low compared to the PPO (75 MPa). The strain hardening modulus is shown not to depend on crystallinity. Indeed, the strain hardening modulus ESH of the semi-crystalline PPA, Polyamide C and Polyamide B, is found to be equal to the hardening modulus of the amorphous. Only the temperature has an influence on the strain hardening modulus ESH: the strain hardening modulus decreases with increasing temperature. Strain hardening is a key feature for resistance to damage"
"Hot runners have evolved with technological advances, offering various applications to improve plastic molding processes. They eliminate the need for cold sprue and runners, leading to reduced scrap. Hot runners facilitate direct gating onto parts using low-vestige tips or valve gates, eliminating three-plate runner systems and enabling gating on the part's outer edge. Sequential valve gates control flow and knit lines on larger parts, while multiple hot drops reduce fill pressures. They also eliminate lengthy cold runners, enhancing the process window.
Although hot runners add complexity and maintenance requirements, modern designs have minimized issues. Hot runners essentially maintain molten plastic temperature through a heated channel, with thermocouples and heaters crucial for precise temperature control. Newer electronic controllers offer improved accuracy and flow control.
Hot-runner tips significantly influence part cosmetics, with various designs available. Low-vestige tips minimize vestige and stringers but can increase fill pressures. Straight-through tips reduce color changes and contamination, while valve gates control flow and knit lines.
Addressing cosmetic issues, cooling and bearing/contact surface at the hot-drop tip are vital. Focus on cooling around hot-drop tips and gate areas can resolve problems. Orifice size is another overlooked factor affecting issues such as pressure loss, drooling, and color changes. Properly adjusting orifice size can optimize the process window and minimize scrap rates.
In conclusion, hot runners have diverse applications, and their effective utilization requires understanding and optimizing various factors, including tip design, orifice size, and cooling strategies."
"Streaking and black specks in injection molded parts can be caused by contamination in the barrel, nozzle, hot runner, or feedthroat. To determine the source of the contamination, run purge shots through each component and examine the purge pile for specks and uneven color distribution. If the contamination is in the barrel, raise the barrel temperature and run several short bursts of agitation at higher screw speed. You can also try increasing the screw rpm and/or backpressure. If the contamination is in the nozzle or hot runner, raise the temperature of the nozzle or hot runners and use short, high-velocity shots to dislodge and remove the contamination. If the contamination is in the hopper or feeding system, implement a standard procedure to clean the hopper and magnets thoroughly. You can also avoid clumping or ""balling-up"" in the feedthroat by keeping it cool. Additional tips for preventing streaking and black specks in injection molded parts are: Use a good quality purging compound that is designed for the specific resins and colors you are using. Follow the purging instructions carefully.Purge the machine thoroughly between resin or color changes.
Keep the hopper and feeding system clean and free of debris. Monitor the temperature of the barrel, nozzle, and hot runners. Inspect the molded parts regularly for signs of contamination."
"Mold flow analysis (MFA) is a computer-aided engineering (CAE) tool that can be used to predict the flow of molten plastic during the injection molding process. This information can be used to improve the design of plastic parts and molds, and to troubleshoot problems that may occur during production. Here are some of the ways that MFA can be used for plastic design and part construction:
Predicting warpage: Warpage is a common problem in injection molded parts. MFA can be used to predict the amount of warpage that a part will experience, and to identify the design features that are contributing to the warpage. This information can then be used to modify the part design to reduce or eliminate warpage.
Optimizing part strength: MFA can be used to optimize the thickness and material distribution of a part to achieve the desired strength. This can be important for parts that are subjected to high loads, such as structural components and medical devices.
Minimizing weld lines: Weld lines are defects that can occur in injection molded parts when two streams of molten plastic meet. MFA can be used to identify areas where weld lines are likely to occur, and to suggest design changes that can minimize or eliminate weld lines.
Improving mold cooling: Mold cooling is an important factor in the production of high-quality injection molded parts. MFA can be used to predict the cooling time of a mold, and to identify areas where the cooling may be inadequate. This information can then be used to modify the mold design to improve the cooling efficiency.
Troubleshooting problems: MFA can be used to troubleshoot problems that may occur during the injection molding process, such as sink marks, voids, and flash. By analyzing the flow of molten plastic, MFA can help to identify the root cause of the problem and suggest solutions.
Overall, MFA is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the design and construction of plastic parts. By using MFA, manufacturers can produce parts that are stronger, more consistent, and less likely to have defects."
Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) is used to reduce development cost since problems can be detected early in the project phase. CAE allows virtual prototyping by applying FEW (Finite Element Analysis) to determine structural problems which MF (Mold Flow) shows potential production problems before a tool has been built. 
"Melt rheology (share flow, stretch flow, viscosity, fill rate, pressure demand, fibre orientation), can explain problems in part performance, part production or feasibility. Polymers are non-Newtonian and their behaviour under pressure, temperature, level of reinforcement  can be anticipated based on their rheological data. "
"A snap-fit is a form-fitting joint used to assemble plastic parts. The main purposes of snap-fits are to hold the mating component and withstand the vibration and durability loads. Several design factors are very crucial in the development of snap-fits, including thickness, beam length, beam width, base radius, mounting angle, and dismounting angle. Snap fits are the easiest, fastest, and most cost-effective joint approach to assemble two parts. When properly designed, elements with snap-fits can be jointed and disjointed repeatedly without any negative impact on the attachment. Snap fit joints are among the simplest and most efficient ways to assemble parts. With snap joints, there is usually no need for different types of fasteners and tools. In its simplest form, a snap joint is a small protrusion that can be a stud, hook, or bead. The deflection of this protrusion occurs during assembly. The main aim is to catch a feature in the mating component."

"“Hot Runners: A View from the Bottom Up” is an article published in Plastics Technology. The article addresses hot-runner benefits, improvements, and everyday issues from the perspective of decades of experience with probably every brand on the market. The purpose of this column is not to promote or discourage the use of hot runners but to provide a better understanding of them from a user viewpoint in the daily injection molding environment. Hot runners have many applications and can be very beneficial to the process, providing savings in cycle time and elimination of cold runner and sprue. However, hot runners can add a significant cost to the tool up front and therefore need to be justified economically. Optimizing pack and hold times for hot-runner and valve-gated molds is a process that involves applying a scientific method to what is typically a trial-and-error process. In valve-gated hot-runner molds, there is no need to differentiate between pack and hold times, because once the gate is mechanically shut after packing, the holding phase does not exist. However, in some cases, it is necessary to differentiate between the pack and hold phases. For example, with softer materials such as polyolefins, TPEs, and TPUs, the part weight continuously increases and does not stabilize in the gate-seal test. The most effective way to optimize pack time, hold time and pressure is through a gate seal study, which measures product weight as a function of time. Then, you can fine-tune the time and pressure until the exact product weight (and thus the correct amount of material in the mold) is achieved. You can also drop the hold pressure in steps of about 17 bar and keep checking the part weight at every reduction."
"In the case of the direct gate system, where multi-gates are located inside the mold cavity, the flow front velocity
was observed to rapidly rise by 5 or 6 times in a moment after a small amount of back flow, due to low pressure loss
at the flow front area just after switching gate open from VG1 to VG2. In the case of sub-runner systems, where multi-gates are located in the tub area outside the cavity, the later VG1 was switched to VG2, the higher was the velocity peak of the melts flowing into the cavity from VG2. All these drastic velocity changes may influence surface transcription conditions, leading to surface defects on molded samples."
"﻿For the past decade, market demands for semicrystalline heat-resistant polyamides (HPAs) with excellent performance and significantly improved heatresistant temperature has grown rapidly, and they are widely used in the electronic and electrical industry, as light-emitting diodes and in the automobile field (as metal replacements). Industrialized HPAs to date, include PA46, PA6T copolyamides, PA9T and PA10T. Other HPAs being researched include full aliphatic HPA, PA5T, long carbon chain HPA, PXD10 and alicyclic HPA. This review addresses progress in HPAs, especially the properties of HPA, patents analysis and polymerization processes"
"Understanding how polymer melts in a single-screw extruder can help optimize screw design to eliminate defect-causing solid polymer fragments. The melting process can be rate-limiting for some single-screw extruders. As screw speed and rate are increased, a maximum rate will occur where the extrudate is completely molten and free of solid polymer fragments. At slightly higher screw speeds, solid polymer fragments start to appear in the extrudate, causing defects in the product. If the drive train is not limiting, this defect can be eliminated via screw design. The melting process can be studied using a Maddock solidification experiment. About 80% of the melting occurs at the barrel side, and the remainder occurs at the other edges."
"Investigation on standard ISO test bars showed that adding 10% regrind has minimal influence on mechanical performance, while adding 20% regrind is only possible for selected parts. Adding more than 20% regrind is not recommended for parts under load. It is assumed that on average, 15% of regrind can be used, and trials have been planned to confirm this. The quality of regrind is important to achieve constant and stable quality of parts and in the injection molding process. The proposal considers the usage of new generated regrind of about 15g and reduction of the current regrind stock by about 10g/machine. Adding regrind will have an effect on the performance of material and finally of the real part. A ratio of up to 10% of good quality regrind has shown a performance reduction of about 5%, which is assumed to be uncritical for most applications. Adding 20% of regrind shows a significant drop in the Viscosity number of about 15%, which is explainable due to the additional processing step. The mechanical performances have dropped by 9%, which is considered acceptable for parts with low load/stress. The usage of more than 20% regrind material leads to a severe reduction in material performance and cannot be recommended for parts under load/stress. For parts that do not have to transmit any forces or moments, the usage of up to 40% regrind is conceivable."
"The crack issue was officially closed with new painting (3-2) and optimized painting conditions. Injection molding processing has very limited influence on the crack result. TR 90 LXS could improve the situation but can’t solve the crack problem. TR90 black batch 6003651/01 shows better results than batch 6003776/01. The SOP was delayed due to brittle crack after painting, but under optimized painting conditions and the latest top coating from PPG, the situation improved. 200 headbands for each color were delivered to INN for testing and passed without cracks. The crack issue was solved and officially closed by Beats and JGP on 26th Feb. 2016. Bending tests will be implemented for mass production, and an additional bending test for two ends was newly developed due to brittle crack. EMS was requested to provide onsite support to improve the situation, although the crack was most likely caused by painting. EVT and DVT tests are planned, with mass production expected at the end of March if they run smoothly. Molding trials were conducted, with painting done after 15-20 hrs with optimized painting conditions. The bending test result is highly dependent on the bending method, and processing and material have very limited influence on the crack and cannot solve the problem. Material with better chemical resistance could help reduce cracks."
"The customer would like to have a counter type to Zytel ST811, with similar properties and possibly less “sticking” to the dome. Considered counter types are Grilon BZ 3/2 and Grilon BRZ 334 H. The mechanical properties of Zytel ST811 and Grilon BRZ-334H are largely comparable, while Grilon BZ 3/2 is significantly stiffer than the other two products. Grilon BRZ 334 H shows a clear increase in weight after oil storage, while Grilon BZ 3/2 shows no change in weight and Zytel ST811 shows a weight reduction. The Zytel ST811 plates warp significantly during oil storage, whereas the Grilon plates remain dimensionally stable. Zytel shows the greatest changes in inner hole diameter. In particular, the products Zytel ST811 and Grilon BRZ 334 H seem to be comparable in the tested properties. However, it is recommended to test the materials in a component test, since dimensional changes always depend on the component."
"The customer wants to conduct a competitive analysis of Kalix 2555 99X, a material with high stiffness and high toughness, to better understand its performance and determine if product development or modification is necessary. The analysis found that the material is based on PA610 containing 50% low dk glass fibers and is very similar to Grivory GV FE 11469. A me-too product is possible, but it cannot be offered as cheaply as Solvay does at the moment. The analysis included material base analysis, filler analysis, and “me too” product development feasibility analysis. The polyamide mainly consists of PA 610 and the material contains 50 wt-% round GF with a low dk composition."
"High levels of stress alsolower a product’s impact strength and can contribute to environmental stress cracking anddiminished performance at high or cycling temperatures. Some common causes of harmful residual stress in molded, thermoformed, and extrudedproducts are differential cooling rates, non-uniform temperature or flow rate, materialcontaminants, mechanical loading, thermal cycling during transport and storage,inadequate or non-uniform annealing, and sharp corners or protrusions that causelocalized stress concentrations. When the stress profile within a plastic part is known, adjustments in the process, material,or part design may be made to eliminate these stresses or reduce them to an acceptablelevel.Problems caused by residual stress in polymers generally fall into one of the followingcategories: Distortion: If you are experiencing field failures of blister packs or similar products, theproblem may be due to stress-relaxation induced distortion.
The part warps or shrinks,causing packaging failures, loss of product, or packages that are visually unattractive.Cracking and crazing: Cracking under normal load conditions is usually evidence ofexcessive residual stress.
Polystyrene parts dipped in kerosene, for example, will craze quickly in stressed areas. Deterioration of optical properties: Residual stress changes a material’s refractive index,thus introducing optical distortion.
This can adversely affect the appearance of productssuch as bottles and windows and the performance of products such as plastic lenses andcompact discs.Creep and other changes in mechanical properties: Creep occurs when residual stressescause initial load deformation to become permanent."
"The customer is looking for a material to produce current collectors for trolleybuses. The part must be electroconductive with a resistivity of no more than 20 Ohm and have low friction. There are several electrically conductive materials available within the EMS Grivory product portfolio, but the electric properties may vary depending on the test method and sample quality. Therefore, the suitability of an electrically conductive product should always be tested for a specific application. For this particular application, a selection of appropriate materials is provided in table 1, with Grilamid L 20 EC being the best material regarding electrical properties. However, it is rather “soft” and may show weaknesses depending on the load case and friction conditions. Products like Grivory GC-4H and XE 4126 bk. 9833 have higher mechanical values and good electrical and tribological properties due to carbon fiber reinforcement. Especially XE 4126 bk. 9833, with its combination of carbon fibers and PTFE modification, will show excellent friction and abrasion behavior."
"The document is about the optimised mould temperature control for injection moulding of thermoplastics. It explains the importance of the cavity wall temperature for the quality and cost-efficiency of the moulded parts, and the methods and tools for designing and calculating the thermal mould design. The main points are:
The cavity wall temperature affects the surface appearance, shrinkage, inherent stresses, uniform structure, geometry and dimensional deviations of the moulded parts. The document provides some examples to illustrate these effects for different thermoplastics and mould materials.
The cavity wall temperature is not constant, but fluctuates periodically during the injection cycle. The contact temperature between the melt and the cavity wall depends on the heat permeativity of the mould and the moulding compound]. The mean cavity wall temperature can be used for estimating the cooling time and the cooling capacity.
The aims of thermal mould design are to maintain a desired mean cavity wall temperature, to achieve a uniform temperature distribution at the cavity surface, and to minimise the cooling time and cycle time for a given moulded part quality.
The document presents some calculation methods for thermal mould design, such as the balance space method, the segmented design of heating/cooling system, and the finite element analysis. It also shows some infrared photographs of moulded parts to demonstrate the temperature distribution and warpage.
The document gives some abbreviations and symbols used in the equations and diagrams, as well as some references for further reading."
"The article is about the mechanical performance of welded and molded butt joints in thermoplastic components. It discusses the effects of molding and welding conditions on the strength and integrity of the joints, and compares the results for different types of plastics. The main points are:
Welded and molded butt joints are common in thermoplastic components, such as pipes, tanks, and housings. They are formed by joining two parts with a weld line or a knit line, which can affect the mechanical properties of the joint.
The article presents experimental data for non-reinforced and reinforced nylon, polypropylene, and polyethylene. It shows that the mechanical performance of the joints depends on the material, the molding temperature, the welding pressure, and the welding time.
The article also provides analytical models for predicting the strength and fracture behavior of the joints, based on the stress distribution and the fracture mechanics. It compares the predictions with the experimental data and shows good agreement.
The article concludes that welded and molded butt joints can achieve high mechanical performance if optimized molding and welding conditions are applied. It also suggests some guidelines for designing and testing thermoplastic components with welded and molded butt joints."

"This document talks about: Dynamic failure of high-voltage busbars: The document investigates the mechanical and electrical behavior of two types of high-voltage busbars (HVBs) under high strain rate loading using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB)]. HVBs are used to connect battery cells in electric vehicles and can fail due to mechanical deformation and short circuit in a crash scenario.

"This document talks about: Abrasive wear of PA 6 and PEEK composites: The authors experimentally investigated the tribological properties of two groups of polymer composites (PA 6 and PEEK) with different fillers (carbon and glass fibers) using a small-scale abrasion tribotesting method. Test conditions and results: The tests were performed using the pin on plane (band) model system with emery cloth as the abrasive surface under different loads (11.5 N and 23 N). The authors found that the fillers had a favorable effect on PA 6 but not on PEEK, and that short carbon fibers improved wear resistance better than short glass fibers. Research project and significance: The study is part of a research project that aims to map the tribological features of different polymer composites. The study could help in selecting or developing polymer composites for applications where abrasion wear is a common failure mechanism."

The materials were polyamide 6 (PA 6) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) with short glass or carbon fibers. The authors measured the tensile strength and modulus of the specimens with and without weld lines.
Results and discussion: The authors found that the weld line strength decreased with increasing thickness and fiber content for both PA 6 and PEEK composites. However, the effect of fiber content was more significant for PA 6 than for PEEK. The authors attributed this to the difference in fiber orientation, viscosity, and interfacial adhesion between the two polymer matrices and the fibers.
Research project and significance: The study is part of a research project that aims to map the tribological features of different polymer composites. The study could help in selecting or developing polymer composites for applications where abrasion wear is a common failure mechanism."

"The report is about the conditioning of parts made from Durethan polyamide resin, a type of nylon plastic, produced by LANXESS Corporation. The report explains that nylon plastics absorb moisture from the atmosphere, which affects their dimensions and physical properties. Therefore, it is important to account for the effects of moisture absorption and to subject nylon parts to active conditioning before they are put into service. The report describes various methods of active conditioning, such as saturated steam, hot water storage, cold water storage, packaging in PE bags, and tropical climate conditioning. The report compares the advantages and disadvantages of each method, such as speed, cost, control, and uniformity of moisture distribution. The report recommends tropical climate conditioning as the best method for parts molded from Durethan nylon, since it provides a fast, effective, and controlled conditioning process with a minimization of the disadvantages noted above. The report also provides tables of approximate time required to reach a specified moisture level as a function of wall thickness and immersion temperature for two types of Durethan nylon (unreinforced and glass-fiber-reinforced). The report is intended for engineers, scientists, and anyone interested in learning more about the conditioning of nylon plastics and their applications. The report is written in a clear and concise style, with technical terms and abbreviations explained. The report is a valuable source of information and guidance for the nylon plastics industry."

"3D-MID (Moulded Interconnect Device) is a technology that creates electrical circuits on 3D-plastic parts. It replaces traditional 2D-circuit boards and wires with a single ""mechatronic"" unit. This offers more design freedom, space, weight, and cost savings. LDS (Laser Direct Structuring) is the most common 3D-MID method for making antennas in mobile devices and tablets. It was developed and patented by LPKF, Germany in 1993. It requires special thermoplastics and lasers approved by LPKF. The list of approved materials is on the LPKF website. Most materials are black due to the LDS additive. LDS became popular for mobile phone antennas (Samsung, Molex) by moving them inside the phone on plastic carriers. The main LDS market is Asia (CN) and the main users are antenna suppliers like Molex, Amphenol, WNC. Automotive companies are also interested in LDS for antennas, switches, sensors. The thermoplastic has a catalyst that the laser activates for plating. The laser also shapes the part surface to improve the bond between the metal circuit and the plastic surface."

"Elastic curve of supported beams: The paper develops two procedures for determining the elastic curve of the simply and multiple supported beams of variable cross-section, which are common models for many parts of machines and structures.
Nonlinear differential equation: The elastic curve is obtained by solving a nonlinear differential equation with given boundary conditions, which is complex and requires an initial guess of the slope at the end of the beam.
Two procedures for initial guess: The paper proposes two methods for obtaining the initial guess: one based on transforming the supported beam into a clamped-free one, and another based on linearizing the problem. The procedures are applied to a simply supported beam and a beam with three supports, and the results are compared.
Advantages and disadvantages: The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both methods, and proves that they give technically accurate results. The paper also mentions some possible ways to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the methods."
